This extension only compatible with chrome

This extension is for me to learn how we can connect external javascript library to the web extension

how to use : go to chrome://extensions/ on the chrome address bar -> enable developer mode -> load unpacked -> select this extension folder(sketch)

This extension will let you doodle on any webpage but losing the ability to highlight and select text(you can still click on link)
